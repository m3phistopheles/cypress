How to get started:
- npm install - in project directory
- npm init - to initialize your package.json file
- npm install cypress --save-dev - to save cypress within that directory
- vim package.json to edit
    - under "scripts:", type - "open":"cypress open"
    - This is so you can run cypress by only typing - npm run cypress
- start cypress with npm run open
- the main test suits are located in the integration folder
- to run the test suit, simply click on it within the cypress application
- this will open a chrome page where you can run through the test step by step to see what was done
